# Tool 3 version `4.0.0`

This major version is a complete redesign of Tool 3. It was entirely rewritten
except for core scientific back-end components. They were left nearly as is in
the source code. The current code base is a refactoring of Tool 1 version
`5.3.0` (RC1) assets as they were on July 21<sup>st</sup>, 2025.
